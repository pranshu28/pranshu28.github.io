I recently joined  [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) / [Polytechnique Montreal](https://www.polymtl.ca) as a PhD student supervised by [Prof. Sarath Chandar](http://sarathchandar.in) ([Chandar Research Lab](https://chandar-lab.github.io)). My primary area of research is Lifelong Learning. 

Before this, I completed my MS in the [Dept. of CSE](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in) at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in), supervised by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Prof. Sarath Chandar](http://sarathchandar.in). The title of my [MS thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11AZHJuRANZovxQ5Ny9SDLKoClnW2K5hQ/view?usp=sharing) was "TAG: Task-based Accumulated Gradients for Lifelong learning". At IITM, I was a part of the [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBCDSAI)](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in) Lab where I worked on several research areas: Lifelong Learning, Causal Inference, Bayesian Networks and Deep Learning. I was also involved in a project in collaboration with [Applied Materials](https://www.appliedmaterials.com). It involved exploring states in the time-series data obtained from the semiconductor manufacturing process. 

I completed my undergrad (B.Tech) in Dept. of CSE, [IIIT-Bhubaneswar](https://www.iiit-bh.ac.in). At IIIT-Bh, I worked on numerous projects at different scales that involved machine learning, image processing, and optimization problems. My Bachelor's [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gyUPFzFd9H0oP6abI5eJ-d-YEd4vpUZK/view?usp=sharing) titled 'Bayesian Optimization and Deep Learning for parameter tuning in Apache Hadoop'. This project was based on a deep learning approach that leveraged the knowledge of system configuration and test dataset to optimize Hadoop parameters to overcome the limitations of Bayesian optimization.
