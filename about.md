I am an MS student in the [Dept. of CSE](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in) at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in), supervised by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) ([IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in)) and [Prof. Sarath Chandar](http://sarathchandar.in) ([MILA/Montreal Polytechnique](https://mila.quebec/en/)). I am a part of the [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBCDSAI)](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in) Lab at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in). My primary area of research is Lifelong Learning. Other research areas include Causal Inference, Bayesian Networks and Deep Learning. Along with that, I am continuing my project work that is in collaboration with Applied Materials. It involves exploring states in the time-series data obtained from the semiconductor manufacturing process. 

Before this, during my undergrad (B.Tech, Dept. of CSE, [IIIT-Bhubaneswar](https://www.iiit-bh.ac.in)), I have worked on numerous projects at different scales that involved machine learning, image processing, and optimization problems. My Bachelor's thesis titled 'Bayesian Optimization and Deep Learning for parameter tuning in Apache Hadoop'. This project was based on a deep learning approach that leveraged the knowledge of system configuration and test dataset to optimize Hadoop parameters to overcome the limitations of Bayesian optimization.
