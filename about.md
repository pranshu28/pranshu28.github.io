I joined as an MS student in the Dept. of CSE at IIT Madras, under the guidance of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) ([RBCDSAI](https://rbc-dsai.iitm.ac.in/)). My current area of research involves the problem of coming up with the notion of 'Self-Reflection' for a given ML model trained in a Lifelong Learning setting. Along with that, I am continuing my project work that is in collaboration with Applied Materials. It involves exploring states in the time-series data obtained from the semiconductor manufacturing process. 

 
At present, I am working as Project Associate at [RBCDSAI](https://rbc-dsai.iitm.ac.in/) in IIT Madras working under the supervision of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/).		 Before this, during my undergrad (B.Tech, Dept. of CSE, IIIT-Bhubaneswar), I have worked on numerous projects at different scales that involved machine learning, image processing, and optimization problems. My Bachelor's thesis titled 'Bayesian Optimization and Deep Learning for parameter tuning in Apache Hadoop'. This project was based on a deep learning approach that leveraged the knowledge of system configuration and test dataset to optimize Hadoop parameters to overcome the limitations of Bayesian optimization. I have also worked with [Prof. Rupaj Kumar Nayak](https://sites.google.com/a/iiit-bh.ac.in/r-k-nayak/) on building AI for Minesweeper game with Constraint Satisfaction Problem and Markov Decision Process based formulations and applying Classification and Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques on it.
