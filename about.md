I recently completed my graduation in the Department of Computer Science, IIIT Bhubaneswar. My Bachelor's thesis was based on exploiting deep learning to overcome the limitations in using conventional Bayesian Optimization technique and tuning low-level parameters in Hadoop as one of its application.

At present, I am working as Project Associate at [RBCDSAI](https://rbc-dsai.iitm.ac.in/) in IIT Madras working under the supervision of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/).

Previously, I had been working with [Prof. Rupaj Kumar Nayak](https://sites.google.com/a/iiit-bh.ac.in/r-k-nayak/) on building AI for Minesweeper game with Constraint Satisfaction Problem and Markov Decision Process based formulations and applying Classification and Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques on it. 

Apart from that, during the summers of 2017, I have worked on Graphical Interpretation of data using [ArangoDB](goo.gl/wWLbmV) and performed memory testing on it. In summer 2016, I worked as an intern at [Winsoft Technologies](http://www.winsoftech.com/), where I designed a Database Management System and conducted weekly sessions on Normalization Techniques, UML, and related concepts. I was also a member of [Coding for All](https://www.facebook.com/C4AIIITBH/) (now [Programming Society](https://www.facebook.com/psocietyiiitbh)) in IIIT-Bh that organized a workshop for more than 150 students to promote Data Science and help them get started with Machine Learning.

I like to work on research and application based [projects](/projects/) that cover domains of deep learning, image and signal processing, machine learning. I also participate in hackathons, coding competitions (qualified in [ACM-ICPC ](http://acm.iitkgp.ac.in/)Regionals, 2016) and recently on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pranshu2). I enjoy solving Math problems and am among the top 7% in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
