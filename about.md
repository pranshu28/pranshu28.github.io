I am a final year student currently pursuing BTech in the Department of Computer Science from IIIT Bhubaneswar. Currently, I am interned at [RISE-lab](http://rise.cse.iitm.ac.in) in IIT Madras under the supervision of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). Previously, I worked with [Prof. Rupaj Kumar Nayak](https://sites.google.com/a/iiit-bh.ac.in/r-k-nayak/) on building AI for Minesweeper game with Constraint Satisfaction Problem and Markov Decision Process based formulations and applying Classification and Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques on it. In 2016, I interned at [Winsoft Technologies](http://www.winsoftech.com/) where I designed a Database Management System and conducted weekly sessions on Normalization Techniques, UML, and related concepts. In Summer 2017, I worked on Graphical Interpretation of data using [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com) and performed memory testing on it. I was also a member of [Coding for All](https://www.facebook.com/C4AIIITBH/) (now [Programming Society](https://www.facebook.com/psocietyiiitbh)) in IIIT-Bh that organized a workshop for more than 150 students to promote Data Science and help them get started with Machine Learning.

I like to work on research and application based [projects](/projects/) that cover domains like deep learning, image and signal processing, machine learning. I also participate in hackathons, coding competitions (qualified in [ACM-ICPC ](http://acm.iitkgp.ac.in/)Regionals, 2017) and recently on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pranshu2). I enjoy solving Math problems and counted among top 7% in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
