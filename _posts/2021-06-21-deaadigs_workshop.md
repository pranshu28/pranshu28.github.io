Summary: The workshop on Data Ethics, Algorithmic Accountability, and Digital Inequality in the Global South aims to contribute to the research on issues surrounding data collection, generation, analysis, dissemination, responsibility assignment for harm in the algorithmic decisions, and inequality in the access and use of information, all of them being relevant in a web setting. Our workshop focuses specifically on the global south, a term often used to identify developing countries, as the aforementioned issues are currently centered in the global north setting. This workshop aims to bring researchers from diverse fields ranging from computer science, philosophy, law, policy, and social sciences to discuss challenging problems related to data ethics, algorithmic accountability, and digital inequality. We have invited several distinguished speakers with their research interests representing voices of the global south.
