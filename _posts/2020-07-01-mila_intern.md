Started a remote internship at [Chandar Research Lab (MILA)](https://chandar-lab.github.io/people/) under the supervision of Prof. [Sarath Chandar](http://sarathchandar.in) and [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). I worked on a Lifelong Learning setting where an agent encounters a continuous stream of data corresponding to different tasks. We propose an optimization-based method that not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also allows positive backward transfer.
